This was a try to add [Undertow](http://undertow.io) servlet container option to the [spring-boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) along the Jetty and Tomcat servlet containers.

Undertow is the basis of the [Wildfly](http://www.wildfly.org/) Application Server which is the basis of the Jboss Application Server and is based on the [XNIO](http://www.jboss.org/xnio) lowlevel I/O library.

Starting with spring-boot 1.2.0 it was merged to the upstream spring-boot.
